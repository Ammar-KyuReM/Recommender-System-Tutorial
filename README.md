# Recommender System Using Machine Learning Techniques

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of various types of recommender systems using machine learning techniques. It explores the two primary approaches—content-based filtering and collaborative filtering—along with their application to the TMDB 5000 Movie dataset. The tutorial also evaluates the performance of these models and discusses future improvements.

## **Key Features**
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies based on metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user interactions and preferences.
- **Evaluation**: Uses Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure model performance.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a foundation for hybrid models and real-time recommendation systems.

## **Project Structure**
- **`Recommendatiion System.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing all implementation code.
- **`RECOMMENDER SYSTEM TUTORIAL.pdf`**: Detailed tutorial explaining the methodology, algorithms, and evaluation metrics.

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `scipy`
